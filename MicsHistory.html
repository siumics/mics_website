            <p>
                     MiCS was originally conceived during the summer of 1997.  The basic concept was for minority computer science students to learn more about the computer science (CS) program and each other earlier in their academic career.  Too often, computer science majors didn't actually get to know their classmates until their Junior/Senior year.  By then, many students had already changed majors or missed opportunities of which they were simply unaware.  It was decided that more of an effort to reach minority underclassmen and increase interaction among the upperclassmen was needed.  Several students believed that forming an organization would provide additional resources and opportunities for minority computer science majors and increase their chances of obtaining a degree in Computer Science.   Also an effort would be made to form stronger bonds with other organizations with similar interests/goals.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                     The primary objective of "To improve the enrollment and graduation rate of  minorities in Computer Science." was established.  It was suggested that the minority CS majors could work with the Minority Engineering Program (MEP) and join the local chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE).  A meeting was arranged with then-director of MEP, Dr. Eugene Cross, and then-vice president of NSBE, Marc Nunn.  It was decided that the CS students would form their own organization, but work closely with NSBE and MEP.  A determent factor was that the computer science department at SIUC was not in the college of engineering.   Members would not be limited to minority students or CS majors - the objectives would be the defining aspect of MiCS.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                     As most of the original CS majors had little or no experience with any organizations, NSBE provided valuable assistance and support as MiCS began to form.  Several of the original member were international students and MiCS also received strong support from then-president of the International Student Council (ISC), Mamadou Coulibaby.  The tedious work of forming a constitution, an executive board, and a faculty advisor began. Members present at the first meeting were:  Keith Alcox, Katisa Brown, Rufus Leggin, Patrick Mburu, Valerie Powe, Als Thompson, and Robert Wigfall.  By the end of the summer, then-chairperson of the computer science department, Dr. Medhi Zargham, agreed to become MiCS faculty advisor.  The founding executive committee was as follows:<br>
            </p>
            <table>
               <tr>
                    <td>Keith Alcox </td>
                    <td> President  </td>
               </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Robert Wigfall</td>
                    <td>Vice President</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Katisa Brown</td>
                    <td> Treasurer </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Rehka Sharma</td>
                    <td>Technical Officer</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Monica Cooper</td>
                    <td>Secratary</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                     Provided with the outstanding example and support of SIUC's local chapter of NSBE and the direct support of then-president, Terrance Lyles, MiCS membership grew to 20+ within the first year.  Meetings were held every two weeks, tutoring session were begun, HTML classes were arranged, resume workshops were provided by University Career Services, and students began to learn more about different opportunities and cultures.  MiCS also gained its 1st alumni at the end of the summer, Als Thompson.  Although Als graduated and returned to Jamaica just as MiCS was beginning, he was a driving force behind the effort to form an organization.  Als and the growing list of alumni all continue to support MiCS and its members as inspirational examples who remain true to MiCS objectives and goals.
